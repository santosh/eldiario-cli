# eldiario

**eldiario** is a command-line utility to write down notes, in the form of a journal.
eldiario is based on the client-server model. eldiario's backend is written in go
which handles API requests. The rest of it is CLI front-end written in Python.

## Installation

The server application needs a working instance of MongoDB running.
With Docker, start a new instance of mongo with:

    docker run -d -p 27017-27019:27017-27019 --name mongodb mongo

The client application is written in Python and is uses requests.
Here you'll be sepending most of the time.

## Usage

When you launch eldiario, you are put inside your choice of editor (eldiario reads `$EDITOR`).

You can pass date-time in the format of YYMMDDHHMMSS to override the `--new` timestamp.
Passing full DateTime helps in sorting.

<!-- ## Configuration -->

## Development

With each diary entry, there goes some metadata which are:

- Datetime: This differentiates one entry from another.
- Author: To show only the entries written by the current user.
- Body: The actual entry.
- UUID: Random generated UUID at the front end
